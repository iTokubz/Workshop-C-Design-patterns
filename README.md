# Workshop-C-Design-Patterns

## Description

This repository contains a collection of exercises related to design patterns in C++. The exercises cover a variety of use cases and combine different design patterns to solve specific problems.

## Usage

To get started, clone the repository and read the header files in each exercise to complete the code.


The exercises are divided into three categories based on their complexity. The first category is designed to help you discover the basics of each design pattern. The second category combines multiple design patterns to solve more complex problems. The third category if you finished everything is completely free and allows you to explore a theme of your choice using design patterns. (maybe start to think if a design pattern that you saw could help you in a project).

If you need help completing an exercise, check the main function or the entire code, or ask for assistance.

## Resources

Before starting the exercises, i recommend reading [Refactoring Guru's Design Patterns in C++](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/cpp) for a better understanding of design patterns.
