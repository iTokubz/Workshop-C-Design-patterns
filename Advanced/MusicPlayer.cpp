//Code it yourself:
//Design pattern used: Singleton, Adapter and Observer.

//Guide:
//1. Create a music player interface that has methods to play and stop music.
//2. Create concrete implementations of the music player interface for MP3 and WAV files.
//3. Implement the singleton pattern for the music player to ensure that there is only one instance of the player.
//4. Create an adapter interface that adapts the music player interface to a common interface that the rest of the program can use.
//5. Create concrete implementations of the adapter interface for the MP3 and WAV players.
//6. Use the observer pattern to notify the user when a song finishes playing.
// 7. Allow the user to play and stop music files.


//Note: you can add any event you want for the observer part, like when a song is added, finished, etc.

//If it's too easy and wanna try to create live music player program that can add, remove, play, skip to left song, skip to right song stop song with a command prompt.
